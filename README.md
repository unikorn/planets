Planets is a CLI game by Aqualabs, which is shared via GNU LGPLv3 license.
This game is a turn-based strategy in the atmosphere of deep cosmos.
Made in Russian language, so anyone could translate it to other language if there's a wish.


The main idea is a battle between three races: Terrains, Lunars and Panyans. They have a few differences: Terrains population growth is higher, Lunars money income is higher and Panyans food producing is higher.
Select your race, unlock different researches, go on the war or make unions.

Original idea brought by a game me and my friends played outdoors. Sitting under the cherry tree, we played very similar game IRL and our money were cherry tree leaves.

Now we are strong enough to code it!
